This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when working with nested routes and parameters in React Router Dom v6. The bug occurs when child components attempt to access route parameters before the parent route has successfully resolved them. This can result in undefined parameter values, causing unexpected behavior and runtime errors. The solution demonstrates how to correctly access and handle route parameters within nested routes using the `useParams` hook, ensuring that the parameters are only accessed after the parent route has successfully matched and resolved them.
